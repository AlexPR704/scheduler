## Day scheduler


## Description
I have created a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
The application will show regular business hours from 9AM-5PM and in each time slot represents one hour.

## Business Context
A daily planner allows employees to see their day at a glance, schedule time effectively, and improve productivity. We have all been there before missing out on small tasks to complete each day and finding out too late it is the worse. This app will be able to help you out to never miss out.
